spark is an open souce distributed framework for large data processing. 
in memory 
spark can work with hadoop 0r without hadoop (stand alone) 
spark is build on a main concept called rdd 
transformation and action is how rdd works.


Apache Spark. ... Spark is a distributed platform for executing complex multi-stage applications, 
like machine learning algorithms, and interactive ad hoc queries. 
Spark provides an efficient abstraction for in-memory cluster computing called Resilient Distributed Dataset.

rdd works on two operations 

2 types of tansformation
-narrow- input and output stays in the same partition
-wide tra

action is the output
create anything 
how to create RDD?
it has 3 ways 
	parallelized collections-
	from RDD's
	External Data



What is transformation and action in spark?
Two types of Apache Spark RDD operations are- 
Transformations and Actions. A Transformation is a function that produces new RDD from the existing RDDs but when we want to work with the actual dataset, at that point Action is performed.


action is the (output, end result, end product) of the transformation 

rdd is an object that represents the dataset and this data can be structurd or umstrutured. 
once a rdd is created its immutable. 
why is it resilient? because rdd are immutable and can't be changed. 
distritubed because its distributed across the cluster 
rdd is an object distributing datasets.
